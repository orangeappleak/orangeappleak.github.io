      <description>Written By: A.Karthik Hello my fellow blog readers, I got an interesting post for you today. Who does not like playing games, almost from 3 year olds to 40 year olds play games on mobile or their pc&amp;rsquo;s or laptops or consoles, lot of options. So today I am going to discuss what unity is and how I developed a 2d game using UNITY.
Unity is a software/game-engine!! So let us say that someday you decided to develop a game all by yourselves by using java or objective-c , this would just be fine if you are in the 1900&amp;rsquo;s but your in 2000&amp;rsquo;s now (this does&amp;rsquo;nt make sense but you get the point).</description>

      <description>Written by: Karthik. Introduction First of all welcome to my fellow WIZARDS and thank you for taking your time to read this.
This being my first post in my blog, I will be taking a moment to discuss why I created this blog and how I did it.
I was thinking of creating a blog for a while now, but never actually did it until recently, there is this AWESOME cousin that I have(I&amp;rsquo;ll provide a link to his blog later in this post) and he had an awesome blog and some good posts, so I got inspired and thought why not create a blog and put some posts up, so that it will help me as well as other code wizards like YOU.</description>
