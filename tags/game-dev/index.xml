      <description>Written By: A.Karthik Hello my fellow blog readers, I got an interesting post for you today. Who does not like playing games, almost from 3 year olds to 40 year olds play games on mobile or their pc&amp;rsquo;s or laptops or consoles, lot of options. So today I am going to discuss what unity is and how I developed a 2d game using UNITY.
Unity is a software/game-engine!! So let us say that someday you decided to develop a game all by yourselves by using java or objective-c , this would just be fine if you are in the 1900&amp;rsquo;s but your in 2000&amp;rsquo;s now (this does&amp;rsquo;nt make sense but you get the point).</description>
