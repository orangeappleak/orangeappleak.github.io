      <description>Written by: Vipul People:&amp;ldquo;YOU SHOULD NOT BE MAKING PROMISES THAT YOU CANT KEEP BRUH&amp;rdquo;.
I know, I know its been long since i posted anything because I had a lot of things happening in MINECRAFT, yeah thats true but I won&amp;rsquo;t be getting carried away by that now(I should write about minecraft someday tho).
So as of now I have written a few posts (YAY for that), but most of them were related to programming and computer stuff , I thought why not make the blog a little interesting by talking about some basic photography(Everyone loves clicking good pics so keep reading).</description>
