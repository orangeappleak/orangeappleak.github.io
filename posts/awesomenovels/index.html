<p>It&rsquo;s been really really long since I posted anything, so here is an interesting post that&rsquo;ll blow your brains out(you can test it out if you want). A lot of people really love reading books but struggle to find some good reads like me, I am a fan of murder-mysteries and yeah today I&rsquo;ll be sharing my top 5 murder-mysteries to read during the lockdown.Well I have no intention of inducing criminal tendencies, so people who are easily persuaded stay out. * <em>EVIL LAUGH</em> *</p>
<h2 id="the-list-of-books-that-you-must-read-during-your-quarantine">The list of books that you must read during your quarantine</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;ll start off with the last one on my list and I won&rsquo;t be revealling to much of anything at all so its a spoiler free post.</p>
<h3 id="5-one-of-us-is-lying---by-karen-m-mcmanus">#5 One Of Us Is Lying - By Karen M. McManus.</h3>
<img id="imageLeft" src = "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/S/aplus-media/vc/b614c6f3-b15a-4b27-a704-93b61b207707.jpg" style = "width: 50%"/>
<p>One of Us is lying is Karen&rsquo;s Debut Novel and it is one of my recent reads.Its not a murder/mystery to be precise, well there is something fishy going on in the plot but its not exactly a mystery. The plot starts with the death of a young boy(stupid,idiotic and alone boy, no offence) who owns a stupid app called &ldquo;About that&rdquo; in which he posts about all the dark secrets of his fellow students. He dies/is murdered when he is sent into detention with 4 other students whose dark secrets were about to be revealed the next day. So the investigation starts with the four students as the prime suspects and yeah there is not much to investigate as the plot concentrates more on the lives of the 4 students. The first half of the story keeps you hooked but when you crack it (and you will if you read carefully,actually you can crack it by reading the image on the left itself) the second half sucks. The whole story revolves around the lives of the 4 students and what they did (but seriously who cares a boy just died and your worried about the others).I would not recommend this book to people who are looking for some detective action, but I would recommend it for casual readers.</p>
<p>you can grab it on <a href="https://www.amazon.in/One-Us-Lying-Karen-McManus/dp/1524764728">AMAZON</a> for 350.</p>

<img id="imageRight" src="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61d1QJ0tPhL.jpg" style="width: 20%"/>
<p>Not to brag or anything but DAN BROWN is the best at what he does(and that is writing novel&rsquo;s XD), before I talk about the book I beg you not to watch the film cause its the worst.Angels and Demons is a best-selling mystery-thriller, it has everthing that you would want.This book is also the first of the Robert Langdon series.The storyline is fast-paced and it keeps you hooked and its a page turner. The books starts of with the death of a scientist whose back is carved with the ILLUMINATI symbol.Robert langdon being a Symbology professor at Harvard is called to investigate the Symbol and then the hunt begins, its race against time. The Storyline dives into the origins of illuminati at the beginning who are on the verge of destroying the whole vatican city with a breakthrough discovery which is stolen from the murdered scientist and our hero Robert Langdon is here to save the day along with the scientists daughter.Dan Brown is known for the details that he provides in his stories, all the structures presented in this book are real life implications but sometimes these details are unecessary and boring but they wont stop you from reading the book.This book has some many plot twists and if I tell you anything it would be a sin.So grab the book and start reading.</p>
<p>I would recommed this book to anyone who is interested in fast paced story telling and plot twists.You can find this book on <a href="https://www.amazon.in/Angels-Demons-Robert-Langdon-Brown/dp/0552161268">Amazon</a> priced at 333.</p>

<p>“I believe that thinking about the problem &hellip;… is your problem.”
&mdash; Dan Brown, Inferno</p>
<p>As I told you his stories are really interesting and I could&rsquo;nt help myself by putting another one of his books on the list. This is another Robert Landon series book and you should be addicted to Dan Brown after reading this and if you are not, well its not my choice to make, is it?. This story starts with Robert Langdon waking up in an Italian hospital with no recollection of the past 36 hours, including a mysterious macabre object hidden in his belongings. He is forced to leave the hospital with a resourceful doctor Siena Brooks when a relentless female assasin is trailing them through Florence.Robert along with Sienna must unravel a series of codes, which are the work of a brilliant scientist obsessed with destroying the world,this scientist was on the watchlist of WHO because he is planning something until he suicides.Now if I write anything further it would be a major spoiler # <em>Robert dies at the end</em> # LOL just kidding.This story has major plot twists that you have to read some chapters twice in order to catch up.</p>
<p>I would recommend this book to everyone who loves to read , You can grab it <a href="https://www.amazon.in/Inferno-Dan-Brown/dp/0593072499">here</a>. I would totally recommend the Hard-Cover version of this book as it is priced very low at 250.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>The pages will burn from the friction from your hands turning them</em>&rdquo; - not my quote.</p>
<p>This is the first book of Alex and my god I am already a die hard fan of this guy, the story telling is massive and precise to the point no additional bullshit and no diversions at all, you just can&rsquo;t stop reading this book once you&rsquo;ve started it. It took me hardly 1 day to finish reading this book, I had to read the finale twice in order for my brain to process what happened. The story starts of with a wife(Alicia Berenson) killng her husband(Gabriel) and she never talks about it ever again, she never opens her mouth.A criminal psychotherapist(Theo Faber) who has waited a long time for the opportunity to work with Alicia. His determination to get her to talk and unravel the mystery of why she shot her husband takes him down a twisting path into his own motivations. The ending will hit you so hard (so yeah wear a helmet when you reach the end).I was in a dilemma whether to put this book on #1 or #2 but I have another spot reserved for #1.</p>
<p>“<strong>You become increasingly comfortable with madness - and not just the madness of others, but your own. We’re all crazy, I believe, just in different ways.</strong>”
― Alex Michaelides, The Silent Patient</p>
<p>Ok now I am zipping my mouth  otherwise you would curse me for revealling too much.</p>
<p>Grab this book <a href="https://www.amazon.in/Silent-Patient-Alex-Michaelides/dp/1250317541">here</a> priced at 305.</p>

<img id="imageLeft" src="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71beLYX9LbL.jpg" style="width:18%"/>
<p>I never thought I would read the works of a Japanese writer but Keigo is the best in his game. The book puts your mind at work and to catch up with the story line you need to read most of the chapters twice.This book is the 3rd in the detective Galileo series and by far the author&rsquo;s most acclaimed work.The novel won him numerous awards including the Naoki price which is a highly regarded award in Japan.</p>
<p>As for the story , Yasuko lives a quiet life, working in a Tokyo bento shop, a good mother to her only child. But when her ex-husband appears at her door without warning one day, her comfortable world is shattered.When Detective Kusanagi of the Tokyo Police tries to piece together the events of that day, he finds himself confronted by the most puzzling, mysterious circumstances he has ever investigated. Nothing quite makes sense, and it will take a genius to understand the genius behind this particular crime&hellip;</p>
<p>This book is a pure masterpiece! The main excitement lies within the totally ground breaking plot twists,The plot is so nicely written that it keeps u hooked up until the last word!.</p>
<p>Its a must read on my list , you can get it <a href="https://www.amazon.in/Devotion-Suspect-X-Keigo-Higashino/dp/0349138737">here</a> at 330.</p>
<p>Thats it for today, but I&rsquo;ll come up with more amazing books to read (because to recommend a book you have to read the book right? LOL).</p>
