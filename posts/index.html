  <h2 class="summary-title"><a href="/posts/my-first-game/">I made a game!!!!!</a></h2>
  <p class="summary-description">So let us say that someday you decided to develop a game all by yourselves by using java or objective-c , this would just be fine if you are in the 1900&#39;s but your in 2000&#39;s now (this does&#39;nt make sense but you get the point).The biggest problem when you decide to develop a game from scratch is that you have to develop your own collision system, a physics engine, an object renderer, a light emission system and a lot of other stuff which is scary right, so instead of finishing the game in 1 year you might end up finishing it in 2 or maybe more years this is where unity comes into picture.Unity has everything that you need to get started, it has its own physics system(which is really complex to understand sometimes), its own animation rig and others that make developing a game lot more fun and interesting.</p>

  <p class="summary-description">It&#39;s been really really long since I posted anything, so here is an interesting post that&#39;ll blow your brains out(you can test it out if you want). A lot of people really love reading books but struggle to find some good reads like me, I am a fan of murder-mysteries and yeah today I&#39;ll be sharing my top 5 murder-mysteries to read during the lockdown.Well I have no intention of inducing criminal tendencies, so people who are easily persuaded stay out. * *EVIL LAUGH* *</p>

  <p class="summary-description">People: YOU SHOULD NOT BE MAKING PROMISES THAT YOU CANT KEEP BRUH.
I know, I know its been long since i posted anything because I had a lot of things happening in MINECRAFT, yeah thats true but I won&#39;t be getting carried away by that now(I should write about minecraft someday tho).
So as of now I have written a few posts (YAY for that), but most of them were related to programming and computer stuff , I thought why not make the blog a little interesting by talking about some basic photography(Everyone loves clicking good pics so keep reading).
The author of this post is a great photographer and I am currently working on his website that&#39;ll help him to show off his skills(sooner or later the website will be completed and you can check it out too).</p>

  <p class="summary-description">Hello my fellow wizards, hope you are making the most of your quarantine season, its been a boring ride just sitting at home and doing nothing, So here i am saving you from the clutches of boredom with an interesting post.
## What is version control and why do you need it? From the title, **Version Control**, you might have guessed the context of this post and your right(dont get too excited, cause you&#39;re partially right).
Whenever you are developing something may that be a software or a website or just some project that you have been working on with some other people, you may have come across many problems that relate to keeping track of your changes and contributions to the project. When these changes and contributions are continuous you might as well lose track of what needs to be done and what is currently going on with the project, in other words you might get confused and loose your head, to avoid this confusion we need to keep track of the changes that we make and that is what version control does.</p>

  <h2 class="summary-title"><a href="/posts/hmmmac/">Hmmmm, MAC??</a></h2>
  <p class="summary-description">We are all familiar with Apple&#39;s laptop Macbook. For those who aren&#39;t here is a brief idea, MacBook Air, Macbook and MacBook Pro are Apple&#39;s versions of laptop. No one addresses it as a laptop actually, everyone calls it a Mac or Macbook. If you own a Macbook then you just have a Macbook not a laptop. These are really expensive like reaaaalllly expensive, a basic version of Macbook costs around 1 lakh, you want some accessories? Well guess what *Apple gives you a lot of accessories for free until you pay more money*. Prices of high end versions, could touch the sky, get upto 4lakhs. These laptops are not meant for playing games cause they do not have powerful graphic cards,instead they are so soft that you can use it as a mouse pad for gaming, so thats an advantage for the MAC. But these laptops are very useful for content creators(video or photo editors), consuming multimedia and even programmers. Now coming to main part USER EXPERIENCE these are the best in class except for gamers. MacOS is the operating system installed on a Macbook and personally I prefer mac os over Windows.</p>

  <h2 class="summary-title"><a href="/posts/whyandhowicreatedthisblog/">Why and how I created this blog??</a></h2>
  <p class="summary-description">First of all welcome to my fellow **WIZARDS** and thank you for taking your time to read this.
This being my first post in my blog, I will be taking a moment to discuss why I created this blog and how I did it.
I was thinking of creating a blog for a while now, but never actually did it until recently, there is this **AWESOME** cousin that I have(I&#39;ll provide a link to his blog later in this post) and he had an awesome blog and some good posts, so I got inspired and thought why not create a blog and put some posts up, so that it will help me as well as other code wizards like YOU.</p>
